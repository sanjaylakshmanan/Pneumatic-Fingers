# Pneumatic-Fingers
ABAQUS simulation of pneumatically controlled finger

Pneumatically controlled fingers are used in robotic arms operated remotely by surgeons. Such fingers are generally made up of a soft polymer such as PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane). 
PDMS has a low Young's modulus and a poissons ratio close to 0.5 (~0.48) which makes it almost incompressible.
