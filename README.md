# Pneumatic-Fingers
ABAQUS simulation of pneumatically controlled finger

Pneumatically controlled fingers are used in robotic arms operated remotely by surgeons. Such fingers are generally made up of a soft polymer such as PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane). 
PDMS has a low Young's modulus and a poissons ratio close to 0.5 (~0.48) which makes it almost incompressible. 
Shows here is the setup of the model on ABAQUS. The left face of the finger has a fixed support (all DOFs set to 0), while a pressure of 0.18 MPa is applied to all the faces of the cavities.
